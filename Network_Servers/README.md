# üìÇ CS 361 Simple HTTP Server Lab

This repository contains my implementation of the **Simple HTTP Server Lab** for **CS 361: Computer Systems II** at James Madison University. The lab focuses on basic network programming and HTTP protocol fundamentals by creating a minimal web server that serves static files on the local machine.

The lab materials and specifications are based on the course content and guidance from **Professor Michael S. Kirkpatrick**. All code and implementation details reflect my own work.

## üß† Lab Overview

This lab implements a basic TCP server that performs the following:

- **Server Initialization:**  
  Creates a TCP server socket bound to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) on a user-specified or default port.

- **Connection Handling:**  
  Listens for and accepts a single incoming client connection.

- **HTTP GET Request Parsing:**  
  Reads the client's HTTP GET request and extracts the requested URI (e.g., `/`, `/index.html`).

- **Static File Serving:**  
  Attempts to open and read the requested file from the current directory.  
  - If the URI is `/`, serves `index.html`.  
  - If the file exists, sends a proper HTTP/1.0 response header with content length and serves the file contents.  
  - If the file does not exist or the request is invalid, returns a `404 Not Found` response.

- **Clean Shutdown:**  
  Closes the client and server sockets after serving the request.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Compile and Run

### Build the program using GCC:
```bash
gcc -o webserver main.c server.c utils.c
```
### Or build using the included Makefile:
```bash
make
```

This will produce an executable named 'webserver'.

### Run the server:
```bash
./webserver [-p port]
```
- -p port: Optional. Specify the port or application protocol to listen on (default is set in the program).

- The server listens on localhost and serves one request before exiting.

### üìÇ Sample Usage
After running the server, you can test it by opening a web browser or using tools like curl:

``` bash
curl http://localhost:PORT/
curl http://localhost:PORT/index.html
curl http://localhost:PORT/bootstrap.html
```
Replace PORT with the port number you specify or the default.

### üóÇÔ∏è Sample Files
Place the following HTML files (or your own) in the same directory as the executable for testing:

- index.html

- bootstrap.html

If a requested file is missing, the server will respond with a 404 error.
