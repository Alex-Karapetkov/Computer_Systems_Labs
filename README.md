# Computer Systems Labs
This repository contains my solutions to lab assignments and projects completed in CS 361: Computer Systems II at James Madison University. The lab materials and project specifications were originally designed by Professor Michael S. Kirkpatrick, and some starter code or documentation was provided as part of the course. However, all final implementations and submitted work in this repository reflect my own effort and understanding.

These labs focus on concurrent systems programming in C, covering topics such as:

- UNIX process and thread management

- Inter-process communication (IPC)

- Synchronization with mutexes and semaphores

- Signals and pipes

- Client-server networking with sockets

All code was tested on the departmental Linux server (stu.cs.jmu.edu) and follows the specifications-based grading approach used in the course.
